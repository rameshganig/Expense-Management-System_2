# Expense-Management-System_2
This project was part of my AI/ML coursework, where I worked with expense datasets stored in a SQL database. The system fetches, processes, and categorizes expense data to generate detailed analytics such as monthly spending trends, category-wise breakdowns, and percentage-based summaries. These insights help users make smarter financial decisions.
